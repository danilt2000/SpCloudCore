# SpCloud

**SpCloud** is a micro-hosting solution running on a developer's laptop, designed for uploading and testing .NET applications. This project provides a simple and efficient way to deploy your projects with minimal time resources.

## Features

- **Application Uploading**: Supports uploading project rar archives via an interface
- **Supported Application Types**: ASP.NET and .NET console applications.
- **Resource Management**: Limited by the laptop's resources; excessive usage may lead to the removal of your application and a ban.






## Guide to Using SpCloud

### 1. Creating the Archive
Compile your .NET application using the **Rebuild** button in Visual Studio.  

It's crucial to use **Rebuild**, not any other options.

Place the generated files into an archive.

### 2. Uploading the Application
Go to the upload interface and select your archive.  

Specify the name and type of your application (e.g., ASP.NET-dotnet asp  or console application-dotnet).

### 3. Recommendations and Warnings
Do not overuse hosting resources.  

If your application consumes excessive resources, it may be removed, and you will be banned.

Use the hosting responsibly and stay updated on any changes.
