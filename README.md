## Guide to Using SpCloud

### 1. Creating the Archive
Compile your .NET application using the **Rebuild** button in Visual Studio.  
It's crucial to use **Rebuild**, not any other options.

### 2. Uploading the Application

### 3. Recommendations and Warnings
Do not overuse hosting resources.  
If your application consumes excessive resources, it may be removed, and you will be banned.

Use the hosting responsibly and stay updated on any changes.
